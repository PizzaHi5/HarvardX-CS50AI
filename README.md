# Why
I am taking this class because I want to learn AI and python. My previous project DeepFi tried to use ChatGPT to create a trading bot. That was a failure. In the process of learning about LLMs, I learned a little about all the different types of AI being developed right now! This is very inspiring and interests me to dive in deeper.
