# Inspiration
I am taking this class because I want to learn AI and python. My previous project DeepFi tried to use ChatGPT to create a trading bot. That was a failure. In the process of learning about LLMs, I learned a little about other types of AI models being developed right now (especially ChatGPTs SORA). This inspired me to dive in deeper!
